/* The common WA overlay dispatcher at 0x801462B0, the entry of the bank the
 * game's loader places at 0x80146000 with every duel package. It holds all
 * the field and card effects (fusion, battle damage, destruction, magic,
 * trap, ritual, terrain, and the rest: ids 0-23) as retail MIPS code with
 * no C source, so the default runs the original routine through the
 * interpreter, which bridges its resident SDK and game calls to the native
 * port. That keeps each effect's own timing, colours and particles.
 *
 * MEMORIES_DUEL_EFFECTS=native restores the bring-up behaviour: fusion (1),
 * battle damage (2) and destruction (3) interpreted, everything else
 * reported complete on its first update. An effect the interpreter cannot
 * run is reported once and completed the same way from then on. */
