/* After the credits. The retail game's last mode never leaves: once the save
 * and the secret number are done, Main_RunCredits (src/game/main_run_credits.c)
 * runs the credits scene in its phase 2 and, every frame after, asks
 * Model_IsCreditsPresentationComplete and drops the answer, so the screen
 * stays black until the console is reset. The port publishes the main
 * menu's mode three seconds after the presentation is complete, as a menu
 * choice would, and the game goes back to the title. The game's own code is
 * not changed. */
